## An Intro to PHP

### The Task:

Create an pencil inventory system that allows voting for favorite pencils.

### Setup and Local Environment

If you don't have experience setting up a LAMP environment on your box, there are several good 3rd party tools:

● Mac/OSX: MAMP

  - Download MAMP, Launch Application, and Start Servers.
  - Tools -> PHP My Admin
  - My Website (localhost)
  - Save Documents in MAMP -> htdocs or configure settings

● Windoze: WAMP

● Linux: You probably already know...

### Requirements:

1. A simple CRUD API endpoint to manage your pencil inventory.

- Should follow the REST paradigm

1. A way to up/down vote and persist the knowledge of votes.

1. A functional DB to persist pencil inventory and votes.


1. A functional UI that:


 - Lists inventory and total votes

 - Allows users to up/down vote the inventory items

 - Sorts inventory by highest vote

 - Allows users to add / remove / update pencils

#### Backend:

- PHP, with no frameworks -- just start writing code in PHP!

- MySql -- or any relational db

- Don't get hung up on security issues or PHP's less-glamorous form processing style.

#### Frontend:

- Javascript

- Angular.js -- or choice of framework

- Bootstrap -- optional


Show your ability to hack on some PHP!
